Breaking down the problem into manageable components to understand the topic, concept, \n        example, and context in question.\n        3. Analyzing the correct answer and instruction of the question to understand how to solve \n        the problem and the step-by-step to the correct answer.\n        4. Compare given question with original question to find out whether they are duplicate or \n        not. Analyze the grammatical structure and meaning of two questions. Determine whether they \n        have the same subject, main verb, and semantic object. Use 'python for everyone' textbook as \n        a knowledge base or ontology to determine whether two questions refer to the same concept or \n        entity.\n        ###\n        I will give you an original question and a list of question. You have to comply with above \n        thought process to compare each question in the list with the original question. Each \n        question will be evaluated through the following fields:\n            'Question': Orginal question,\n            'Correct answer': Correct answer of the question,\n            'Instruction': Correct answer explanation of the question,\n            'IoU score': Similarity score based on knowledge from the book between this question and original question\n            'Semantic score': the semantic score calculated between questions\n        ###\n        Your response must follow below JSON format: \n        {\n            'Id': ...\n            {\n                Level:...,\n                Reason:...\n            },\n        }\n        \n        With 'Id' is the Id of the question to be compared with original question, 'Level' is 0 for not duplicate or 1 for duplicate base on involves 4.\n        Reason is the reason why you conclude that level. Reason is a string.\n        ###\n        Original question: {'id': 259, 'question_content': \"What is the output of the following code snippet? def func(message, num = 1): print(message * num)  func('Welcome') func('Viewers', 3)  \\r\\nA.Welcome Viewers \\r\\nB.Welcome ViewersViewersViewers\\r\\nC.

Analyzing the correct answer and instruction of the question to understand how to solve \n        the problem and the step-by-step to the correct answer.\n        4. Compare given question with original question to find out whether they are duplicate or \n        not. Analyze the grammatical structure and meaning of two questions. Determine whether they \n        have the same subject, main verb, and semantic object. Use 'python for everyone' textbook as \n        a knowledge base or ontology to determine whether two questions refer to the same concept or \n        entity.\n        ###\n        I will give you an original question and a list of question.

Determine whether they \n        have the same subject, main verb, and semantic object. Use 'python for everyone' textbook as \n        a knowledge base or ontology to determine whether two questions refer to the same concept or \n        entity.\n        ###\n        I will give you an original question and a list of question. You have to comply with above \n        thought process to compare each question in the list with the original question. Each \n        question will be evaluated through the following fields:\n            'Question': Orginal question,\n            'Correct answer': Correct answer of the question,\n            'Instruction': Correct answer explanation of the question,\n            'IoU score': Similarity score based on knowledge from the book between this question and original question\n            'Semantic score': the semantic score calculated between questions\n        ###\n        Your response must follow below JSON format: \n        {\n            'Id': ...\n            {\n                Level:...,\n                Reason:...\n            },\n        }\n        \n        With 'Id' is the Id of the question to be compared with original question, 'Level' is 0 for not duplicate or 1 for duplicate base on involves 4.\n        Reason is the reason why you conclude that level.
